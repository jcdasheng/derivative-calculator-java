### Java implementation for derivative calculation

Single iteration(Original):
- Parse function given as String in the format similar to ```x^5+5x^2-7x+2```
- Find roots of the function using Newton-Raphson algorithm
- Find the first order derivative and return as ```Function```

Added features: 
- Chain rules, exponential rules, addition rules, quotient rules.
